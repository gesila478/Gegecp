Debian Ubuntu Simple Management Panel
Installation command:

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gesila478/gegecp/refs/heads/main/uninstall.sh | sudo bash && curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gesila478/gegecp/refs/heads/main/online_install.sh | sudo bash

Found an obvious bug
When editing json in file management, there is no content when opening the file. I really don't know how to fix this problem!
